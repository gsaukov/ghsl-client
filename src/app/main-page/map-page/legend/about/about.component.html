      <span> Hello and welcome to 2025 population density map!</span>
      <span><br></span>
      <span>Global Human Settlement Layer, or Population Density map data that uses data from European Union's Copernicus Project
        <a class="dark-link" target="_blank" href="https://human-settlement.emergency.copernicus.eu/">human-settlement.emergency.copernicus.eu</a> and represent global human density layer for year 2025.<br>
      </span>
      <span>Depending on a zoom level Population density map is showing 3 different by size kind of blocks:</span>
      <ol>
        <ul> 3ss 10000m<sup>2</sup> - 100 x 100 meters rectangles. On this level you can examine population density of a street or even house level.</ul>
        <ul> 30ss 1km<sup>2</sup> - 1 x 1 kilometer rectangle. This level best represent regional or urban population density.</ul>
        <ul> 90ss 9km<sup>2</sup> - 3 x 3 kilometers rectangle. On this zoom level you global human presence on a scale of a country, continent or even whole world! Try it in dark mode!</ul>
      </ol>
      <span>Depending on population density blocks change their color from transparent light green that just indicate some human presence on the surface to white and light blue color of rural areas, city outskirts or small towns, next are blue and violet blocks that show moderate urban density to finally red and yellow that indicate highest levels of human presence.<br></span>
      <span>For any questions related to dataset figures please refer to original <a class="dark-link" target="_blank" href="https://human-settlement.emergency.copernicus.eu/">GHSL source</a> that has clear explanation of data gathering and calculation methods per different world region or country.</span>
