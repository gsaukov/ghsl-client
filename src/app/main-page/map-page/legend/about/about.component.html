      <span> Hello and welcome to 2025 population density map!</span>
      <span><br></span>
      <span>Global Human Settlement Layer, or Population Density map data that uses data from European Union's Copernicus Project
        <a class="dark-link" target="_blank" href="https://human-settlement.emergency.copernicus.eu/">human-settlement.emergency.copernicus.eu</a> and represent global human density layer for year 2025.<br>
      </span>
      <span>Depending on a zoom level Population density map is showing 3 different by size kind of blocks:</span>
      <ol>
        <ul> 3ss 10000m<sup>2</sup> (100 x 100 meters rectangle) files originate from the original images with a resolution of 3 arcseconds, with dimensions 12000x12000 pixels. Each of these images is divided into 16 smaller images, each sized 3000x3000 pixels (arranged in a 4x4 grid). This process reduces a single PNG image, typically around 70MB in size, into 16 smaller images, each with a maximum size of around 5MB.</ul>
        <ul> 30ss 1km<sup>2</sup> (1 x 1 kilometers rectangle), on the other hand, are derived directly from the original images with a resolution of 30 arcseconds, with dimensions 1200x1200 pixels. These files undergo no transformation except for adjustments to the color scheme and conversion from TIFF to PNG format.</ul>
        <ul> 90ss 9km<sup>2</sup> (3 x 3 kilometers rectangle), they are created by combining and compressing 30ss files. Specifically, nine 30ss files arranged in a 3x3 grid are merged and compressed into a single 90ss file, maintaining a resolution of 1200x1200 pixels.</ul>
      </ol>
      <span>Depending on population density blocks change their color from transparent light green <br></span>
